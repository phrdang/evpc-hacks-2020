None	Cyrus II of Persia, commonly known as Cyrus the Great, and also called Cyrus the Elder by the Greeks, was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, the first Persian Empire. Under his rule, the empire embraced all the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia. From the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen. Under his successors, the empire eventually stretched at its maximum extent from parts of the Balkans (Bulgaria-Paeonia and Thrace-Macedonia) and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Greco-Persian Wars	73,800+	499 BC-449 BC	Greek City-States vs. Persian Empire	Greece		Persian Wars	The Greco-Persian Wars were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire and Greek city-states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to control the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Samnite Wars	33,500+	343 BC-290 BC	Roman Republic vs. Samnites	Italy	Number given is the sum of all deaths in battle recorded by Roman writers during this time period, does not take into account civilian deaths, the actual number may be much greater.	None	The First, Second, and Third Samnite Wars (343-341 BC, 326-304 BC, and 298-290 BC) were fought between the Roman Republic and the Samnites, who lived on a stretch of the Apennine Mountains south of Rome and north of the Lucanians. The first of these wars was the result of Rome's intervention to rescue the Campanian city of Capua from a Samnite attack. The second one was the result of Rome's intervention in the politics of the city of Naples and developed into a contest over the control of central and southern Italy. The third war also involved a struggle over the control of this part of Italy.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Wars of Alexander the Great	142,000+	336 BC-323 BC	Macedonian Empire and other Greek City-States vs. various states	Middle East / North Africa / Central Asia / India	Number given is the sum of all deaths in battle during these wars recorded by Greek writers, does not take into account civilian deaths, the actual number may be much greater.	None	The wars of Alexander the Great were fought by King Alexander III of Macedon ("The Great"), first against the Achaemenid Persian Empire under Darius III, and then against local chieftains and warlords as far east as Punjab, India (in modern history). By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks. However, he failed to conquer all of South Asia. Although being successful as a military commander, he failed to provide any stable alternative to the Achaemenid Empire—his untimely death threw the vast territories he conquered into civil war.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Punic Wars	1,250,000-1,850,000	264 BC-146 BC	Roman Republic vs. Carthaginian Empire	Western Europe / North Africa		None	The Punic Wars were a series of three wars between 264 and 146 BC fought by the states of Rome and Carthage. The First Punic War broke out in Sicily in 264 BC as a result of Rome's expansionary attitude combined with Carthage's proprietary approach to the island. At the start of the war Carthage was the dominant power of the western Mediterranean, with an extensive maritime empire; while Rome was a rapidly expanding power in Italy, with a strong army but a weak navy. The fighting took place primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia. It lasted 23 years, until 241 BC, when after immense materiel and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated. By the terms of the peace treaty Carthage paid large reparations and Sicily was annexed as a Roman province. The end of the war sparked a major but unsuccessful revolt within the Carthaginian Empire known as the Mercenary War.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	First Punic War	400,000+	264 BC-241 BC	Roman Republic vs. Carthaginian Empire	Southern Europe / North Africa	- Part of the Punic Wars		The First Punic War (264-241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the early 3rd century BC. For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy. The wars were fought primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Second Punic War	770,000+	218 BC-201 BC	Roman Republic vs. Carthaginian Empire	Western Europe / North Africa	[1] - Part of the Punic Wars		The Second Punic War (218-201 BC) was the second of three wars fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC. For seventeen years, the two states struggled for supremacy, primarily in Italy and Iberia, but also on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and, towards the end of the war, in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated. Macedonia, Syracuse and several Numidian kingdoms were drawn into the fighting; and Iberian and Gallic forces fought on both sides. There were three main military theatres during the war: Italy, where the Carthaginian general Hannibal defeated the Roman legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary campaigns in Sicily, Sardinia and Greece; Iberia, where Hasdrubal, a younger brother of Hannibal, defended the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success until moving into Italy; and Africa, where the war was decided.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Third Punic War	150,000-250,000	149 BC-146 BC	Roman Republic vs. Carthaginian Empire	Tunisia	- Part of the Punic Wars		The Third Punic War (149-146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars fought between Carthage and Rome. The war was fought entirely within Carthaginian territory, in modern northern Tunisia. When the Second Punic War ended in 201 BC, one of the terms of the peace treaty prohibited Carthage from waging war without Rome's permission. Rome's ally, King Masinissa of Numidia, exploited this to repeatedly raid and seize Carthaginian territory with impunity. In 149 BC Carthage sent an army, under Hasdrubal, against Masinissa, the treaty notwithstanding. The campaign ended in disaster as the Battle of Oroscopa ended with a Carthaginian defeat and the surrender of the Carthaginian army. Anti-Carthaginian factions in Rome used the illicit military action as a pretext to prepare a punitive expedition.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Kalinga War	150,000-200,000	262 BC-261 BC	Maurya Empire vs. State of Kalinga	India			The Kalinga War (ended c. 261 BCE) was fought in ancient India between the Maurya Empire under Ashoka and the state of Kalinga, an independent feudal kingdom located on the east coast, in the present-day state of Odisha and north parts of Andhra Pradesh. It is presumed that the battle was fought on Dhauli hills in Dhauli which is situated on the banks of Daya River. The Kalinga War included one of the largest and deadliest battles in Indian history. Kalinga did not have a king as it was culturally run without any.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Qin's Wars of Unification	700,000+	230 BC-221 BC	Qin state vs. Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, Chu, Qi States	China	- Part of Warring States Period		Qin's wars of unification were a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the Qin state against the other six major Chinese states — Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, Chu and Qi. Between 247 BC and 221 BC, Qin had emerged as one of the most powerful of the Seven Warring States in China. In 230 BC, Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, unleashed the final campaigns of the Warring States period, setting out to conquer the remaining states one by one. Following the fall of Qi in 221 BC, China was unified under Qin control. Ying Zheng declared himself "Qin Shi Huang" (meaning "First Emperor of Qin") and established the Qin dynasty, becoming the first sovereign ruler of a unified China.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Cimbrian War	410,000-650,000	113 BC-101 BC	Roman Republic vs. Cimbri and Teutones	Western Europe	- Part of the Germanic Wars		The Cimbrian or Cimbric War (113-101 BC) was fought between the Roman Republic and the Germanic and Celtic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons, Ambrones and Tigurini, who migrated from the Jutland peninsula into Roman controlled territory, and clashed with Rome and her allies. The Cimbrian War was the first time since the Second Punic War that Italia and Rome itself had been seriously threatened.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Gallic Wars	1,000,000+	58 BC-50 BC	Roman Republic vs. Gallic tribes	France			The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against numerous Gallic tribes between 58 BC and 50 BC. They culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the Gallic tribes' internal divisions helped ease victory for Caesar; Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. Although Caesar portrayed the invasion as being a preemptive and defensive action, most historians agree he fought the wars primarily to boost his political career and to pay off his massive debts. Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as native tribes, both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north, had attacked them several times. Conquering Gaul allowed Rome to secure the natural border of the Rhine river.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Iceni Revolt	150,000+	60-61	Roman Empire vs. Celtic tribes	England	Year is uncertain - Part of the Roman Conquest of Britain		In AD 60 or 61, when the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was campaigning on the island of Mona (modern Anglesey) on the northwest coast of Wales, Boudica led the Iceni, the Trinovantes, and others in revolt. They destroyed Camulodunum (modern Colchester), earlier the capital of the Trinovantes but at that time a colonia, a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers and site of a temple to the former Emperor Claudius. Upon hearing of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to Londinium (modern London), the 20-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target. He lacked sufficient numbers to defend the settlement, and he evacuated and abandoned Londinium. Boudica led a very large army of Iceni, Trinovantes, and others against a detachment of the Legio IX Hispana, defeating them, and burning Londinium and Verulamium.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Jewish-Roman Wars	1,270,000-2,000,000 [3]	66-136	Roman Empire vs. Jews	Middle East/North Africa	Deaths caused by Roman attempt to permanently root out Judaism included.		The Jewish-Roman wars were a series of large-scale revolts by the Jews of the Eastern Mediterranean against the Roman Empire between 66 and 135 CE. While the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 CE) were nationalist rebellions, striving to restore an independent Judean state, the Kitos War was more of an ethno-religious conflict, mostly fought outside Judea Province. Hence, some sources use the term Jewish-Roman Wars to refer only to the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 CE), while others include the Kitos War (115-117 CE) as one of the Jewish-Roman wars.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	First Jewish-Roman War	250,000-1,100,000[3]	66-73	Roman Empire vs. Jews	Middle East	- Part of Jewish-Roman Wars		The First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 CE), sometimes called the Great Jewish Revolt (Hebrew: המרד הגדול‎ ha-Mered Ha-Gadol), or The Jewish War, was the first of three major rebellions by the Jews against the Roman Empire, fought in Roman-controlled Judea, resulting in the destruction of Jewish towns, the displacement of its people and the appropriation of land for Roman military use, as well as the destruction of the Jewish Temple and polity.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Kitos War	440,000+	115-117	Roman Empire vs. Jews	Southern Europe / North Africa	- Also known as the Second Jewish-Roman War - Part of Jewish-Roman Wars	Second Jewish-Roman War	The Kitos War was one of the major Jewish-Roman wars (66-136). The rebellions erupted in 115, when most the Roman armies were fighting Trajan's Parthian War on the eastern border of the Roman Empire. Major uprisings by Jews in Cyrenaica, Cyprus and Egypt spiralled out of control, resulting in a widespread slaughter of the remaining Roman garrisons and Roman citizens by Jewish rebels.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Fought circa 132-136 CE, it was the last of three major Jewish-Roman wars, so it is also known as The Third Jewish-Roman War or The Third Jewish Revolt. Some historians also refer to it as the Second Revolt of Judea, not counting the Kitos War (115-117 CE), which had only marginally been fought in Judea.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Gothic War (269)	320,000+	269	Roman Empire vs. Goths	Europe	Claudius II defeated the Goths, of whom 320,000 were slain. This number is from the Historia Augusta. - Part of the Germanic Wars		At the Battle of Naissus, Claudius and his legions routed a huge Gothic army. Together with his cavalry commander, the future Emperor Aurelian, the Romans took thousands of prisoners, destroyed the Gothic cavalry as a force, and stormed their laager (a circular alignment of wagons long favored by the Goths). The victory earned Claudius his surname of "Gothicus" (conqueror of the Goths), and that is how he is known to this day. More importantly, the Goths were soon driven back across the Danube River by Aurelian, and nearly a century passed before they again posed a serious threat to the empire.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Probus's German War	400,000+	277	Roman Empire vs. Germans	Europe	Emperor Probus informed the Senate that he had killed 400,000 Germans. From the Historia Augusta. - Part of the Germanic Wars		In 278, Probus campaigned successfully in Gaul against the Alamanni and Longiones; both tribes had advanced through the Neckar valley and across the Rhine into Roman territory. Meanwhile, his generals defeated the Franks and these operations were directed to clearing Gaul of Germanic invaders (Franks and Burgundians), allowing Probus to adopt the titles of Gothicus Maximus and Germanicus Maximus. Reportedly, 400,000 barbarians were killed during Probus' campaign, and the entire nation of the Lugii were extirpated.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

It was one of the many Gothic Wars with the Roman Empire.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Three Kingdoms War	36,000,000-40,000,000	184-280	Wei vs. Shu vs. Wu	China	[4][5] - Academically, the period of the Three Kingdoms refers to the period between the foundation of the state of Wei in 220 and the conquest of the state of Wu by the Jin dynasty in 280. The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China. See: End of the Han Dynasty		Academically, the period of the Three Kingdoms refers to the period between the foundation of the state of Wei in 220 AD and the conquest of the state of Wu by the Jin dynasty in 280. The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China. The middle part of the period, from 220 to 263, was marked by a more militarily stable arrangement between three rival states of Wei, Shu, and Wu. The later part of the era was marked by the conquest of Shu by Wei (263), the usurpation of Wei by the Jin dynasty (265), and the conquest of Wu by the Jin (280).	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Ancient	Yellow Turban Rebellion	3,000,000-7,000,000	184-205	Peasants vs. Eastern Han China	China	- Part of Three Kingdoms War	Yellow Scarves Rebellion	The Yellow Turban Rebellion was a peasant revolt in China against the Eastern Han dynasty. The uprising broke out in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling. Although the main rebellion was suppressed by 185 AD, pockets of resistance continued and smaller rebellions emerged in later years. It took 21 years until the uprising was fully suppressed in 205 AD. The rebellion, which got its name from the colour of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebels' association with secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

The Sixteen Kingdoms, less commonly the Sixteen States, was a chaotic period in Chinese history from 304 to 439 AD when the political order of northern China fractured into a series of short-lived dynastic states, most of which were founded by the "Five Barbarians", non-Han peoples who had settled in northern and western China during the preceding centuries and participated in the overthrow of the Western Jin dynasty in the early 4th century. The kingdoms founded by ethnic Xiongnu, Xianbei, Di, Jie, Qiang, as well as Han and other ethnicities, took on Chinese dynastic names, and fought against one another and the Eastern Jin dynasty, which succeeded the Western Jin and ruled southern China. The period ended with the unification of northern China in the early 5th century by the Northern Wei, a dynasty established by the Xianbei Tuoba clan, and the history of ancient China entered the Northern and Southern dynasties period.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

The Romans became aware of the Huns when the latter's invasion of the Pontic steppes forced thousands of Goths to move to the Lower Danube to seek refuge in the Roman Empire in 376. The Huns conquered the Alans, most of the Greuthungi or Eastern Goths, and then most of the Thervingi or Western Goths, with many fleeing into the Roman Empire. In 395 the Huns began their first large-scale attack on the Eastern Roman Empire. Huns attacked in Thrace, overran Armenia, and pillaged Cappadocia. They entered parts of Syria, threatened Antioch, and passed through the province of Euphratesia. At the same time, the Huns invaded the Sasanian Empire. This invasion was initially successful, coming close to the capital of the empire at Ctesiphon; however, they were defeated badly during the Persian counterattack.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Medieval	Moorish Wars	5,000,000+	534-548	Moors vs. Byzantine Empire	North Africa			When the Romans landed in Africa, the Moors maintained a neutral stance, but after the quick Roman victories, most of their tribes pledged loyalty to the Empire. The most significant tribes were the Leuathae in Tripolitania, and the Frexi in Byzacena. The Frexi and their allies were led by Antalas, while other tribes in the area followed Cutzinas. The Aurasii (the tribes of the Aurès Mountains) in Numidia were ruled by Iaudas, and the Mauretanian Moors were led by Mastigas and Masuna.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Medieval	An Lushan Rebellion	13,000,000-36,000,000	755-763	Tang Dynasty China and Islamic Empire vs. Yan state	China		An-Shi Rebellion	The An Lushan Rebellion was an uprising against the Tang dynasty of China towards the mid-point of the dynasty (from 755 to 763), with an attempt to replace it with the Yan dynasty. The rebellion was originally led by An Lushan, a general officer of the Tang military system. The event involved military activity and direct deaths from battle, but also significant associated population loss from famine, and population dislocations. The event is also known, especially in Chinese historiography, either as the An-Shi Rebellion or as the An-Shi Disturbances. The use of the term luàn indicates the huge amount of social disturbance and population loss eventually involved, way beyond the initial consequences of the rebellion.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

The war began in 1075 when the Vietnamese king ordered a preemptive invasion of the Song dynasty with more than 80,000 soldiers, where Đại Việt's forces defeated the Song army and razed the city of Yongzhou to the ground after a forty-two day siege. In response, a Song army of 300,000 crossed the border in 1076 and by 1077 nearly reached Đại Việt's capital Thăng Long before being halted by general Lý Thường Kiệt at the Nhu Nguyệt River in modern Bắc Ninh Province. After a long battle at the river with high casualties on both sides, Lý Thường Kiệt offered peace to the Song, and the Song commander Guo Kui agreed to withdraw his troops, ending the war.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Medieval	Crusades	1,000,000-3,000,000	1095-1291	Originally Byzantine Empire vs. Seljuq Empire, but evolved into Christians vs. Muslims.	Europe / Middle East ("Holy Land")	[12]		The Crusades were a series of religious wars initiated, supported, and sometimes directed by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The term refers especially to the Eastern Mediterranean campaigns in the period between 1095 and 1271 that had the objective of conquering the Holy Land from Islamic rule. The term has also been applied to other church-sanctioned campaigns fought to combat paganism and heresy, to resolve conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups, or to gain political and territorial advantage. The difference between these campaigns and other Christian religious conflicts was that they were considered a penitential exercise that brought forgiveness of sins declared by the church. Historians contest the definition of the term "crusade". Some restrict it to only armed pilgrimages to Jerusalem; others include all Catholic military campaigns with a promise of spiritual benefit; all Catholic holy wars; or those with a characteristic of religious fervour.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

The Crusade was prosecuted primarily by the French crown and promptly took on a political aspect, resulting in not only a significant reduction in the number of practising Cathars, but also a realignment of the County of Toulouse in Languedoc, bringing it into the sphere of the French crown, and diminishing both Languedoc's distinct regional culture and the influence of the counts of Barcelona.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Medieval	Wars of Scottish Independence	60,000-150,000	1296-1357	Scotland vs. England	Scotland / England			The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The First War (1296-1328) began with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328. The Second War (1332-1357) began with the English-supported invasion by Edward Balliol and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended in 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick. The wars were part of a great crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most defining times in its history. At the end of both wars, Scotland retained its status as an independent state. The wars were important for other reasons, such as the emergence of the longbow as a key weapon in medieval warfare.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Medieval	Conquests of Timur	8,000,000-20,000,000	1370-1405	Timurid Empire vs. several middle eastern states	Eurasia	[19][20]		Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370. From that base, he led military campaigns across Western, South and Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Southern Russia, and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria, the emerging Ottoman Empire, and the declining Delhi Sultanate of India. From these conquests, he founded the Timurid Empire, but this empire fragmented shortly after his death.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Medieval	Wars of the Roses	35,000-50,000	1455-1487	House of Lancaster, House of Tudor, and allies vs. House of York and allies	England / Wales	[21][better source needed]		The Wars of the Roses were a series of fifteenth-century English civil wars for control of the throne of England, fought between supporters of two rival cadet branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster, represented by a red rose, and the House of York, represented by a white rose. Eventually, the wars eliminated the male lines of both families. The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties. The power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the Hundred Years' War, unfolding the structural problems of bastard feudalism, combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King Henry VI which revived interest in the House of York's claim to the throne by Richard of York. Historians disagree on which of these factors was the main reason for the wars.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by Spanish conquerors, their indigenous allies, and the defeated Aztecs. It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the Aztec Empire but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the Mexica of Tenochtitlan over a two-year period. For the Spanish, the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Spanish conquest of Yucatán	1,460,000+	1519-1595	Spanish Colonial Empire vs. Mayan States	North America	[22] - Part of the European colonisation of the Americas, includes deaths due to European disease		The Spanish conquest of Yucatán was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the Yucatán Peninsula, a vast limestone plain covering south-eastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and all of Belize. The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire	8,400,000+	1533-1572	Spanish Colonial Empire vs. Inca Empire	Peru	[22] - Part of the European colonization of the Americas, includes deaths due to European diseases	Conquest of Peru	The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 168 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro, his brothers, and their native allies captured the Sapa Inca Atahualpa in the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest of the Inca Empire (called "Tahuantinsuyu" or "Tawantinsuyu" in Quechua, meaning "Realm of the Four Parts"), led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia, as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

It failed because of intense opposition from the aristocracy, who slaughtered up to 100,000 of the 300,000 poorly armed peasants and farmers. The survivors were fined and achieved few, if any, of their goals. Like the preceding Bundschuh movement and the Hussite Wars, the war consisted of a series of both economic and religious revolts in which peasants and farmers, often supported by Anabaptist clergy, took the lead. The German Peasants' War was Europe's largest and most widespread popular uprising prior to the French Revolution of 1789.

Modern	Eighty Years' War	600,000-700,000	1568-1648	Dutch Republic, England, Scotland, and France vs. Spanish Empire	Worldwide		Dutch War of Independence	The Eighty Years' War was a revolt of the Seventeen Provinces of what are today the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg against Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands. After the initial stages, Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the northern provinces continued their resistance. They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies, and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The war continued in other areas, although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened. This included the origins of the Dutch colonial empire, which began with Dutch attacks on Portugal's overseas territories. At the time, this was conceived as carrying the war with the Spanish Empire overseas due to Portugal and Spain's being in a dynastic union.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American ("creole") identity separate from that of Iberia, political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans, nor was it necessarily inevitable. With the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814, the King rejected any type of popular sovereignty, as seen in the Spanish Constitution of 1812 passed by the Cortes of Cádiz - the parliamentary Regency in place while Ferdinand VII was deposed.

Longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at the Ottoman Empire's expense. The war stood out for its "notoriously incompetent international butchery".	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Panthay Rebellion	890,000-1,000,000	1856-1873	Qing China vs. Hui	China		Du Wenxiu Rebellion	The Panthay rebellion (1856-1873) was a rebellion of the Muslim Hui people and other (Muslim as well as non-Muslim) ethnic groups against the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty in southwestern Yunnan Province, as part of a wave of Hui-led multi-ethnic unrest.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Indian Rebellion of 1857	800,000-1,000,000	1857-1858	Sepoy Mutineers vs. British East India Company	India		Sepoy Mutiny, Indian First War of Independence	The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857-58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi (that area is now Old Delhi). It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	American Civil War	650,000-1,000,000	1861-1865	Union States vs. Confederate States	USA			The American Civil War (also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865, fought between northern states loyal to the Union and southern states that had seceded to form the Confederate States of America. The principal cause of the war was whether the enslavement of black people in the southern states should continue.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Dungan Revolt	8,000,000-20,000,000	1862-1877	Qing China vs. Hui vs. Kashgaria	China		Tongzhi Hui Revolt, Hui (Muslim) Minorities War 	The Dungan Revolt (1862-1877) was a war fought in 19th-century western China, mostly during the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861-1875) of the Qing dynasty. The term sometimes includes the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan, which occurred during the same period. However, this article relates specifically to the uprising by members of the Muslim Hui and other Muslim ethnic groups in China's Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia provinces, as well as in Xinjiang, between 1862 and 1877.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Modern	Paraguayan War	300,000-1,200,000	1864-1870	Triple alliance vs. Paraguay	South America	 	War of the Triple Alliance	The Paraguayan War was a South American war fought from 1864 to 1870, between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin America's history. It particularly devastated Paraguay, which suffered catastrophic losses in population (the numbers are disputed and the true mortality rate may never be known) and was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Ten Years' War	241,000+	1868-1878	Spain vs. Cuba	Cuba		Great War, the War of '68	The Ten Years' War was part of Cuba's fight for independence from Spain. The uprising was led by Cuban-born planters and other wealthy natives. On October 10, 1868 sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes and his followers proclaimed independence, beginning the conflict. This was the first of three liberation wars that Cuba fought against Spain, the other two being the Little War (1879-1880) and the Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898). The final three months of the last conflict escalated with United States involvement, leading to the Spanish-American War.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Conquest of the Desert	30,000-35,000	1870s-1884	Argentina vs. Mapuche people	Patagonia			The Conquest of the Desert was an Argentine military campaign directed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s with the intention of establishing dominance over the Patagonian Desert, inhabited primarily by indigenous peoples. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of Chilean expansion there. Argentine troops killed more than 1,000 Mapuche and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. White settlers moved in and developed the lands through irrigation for agriculture, turning the territory into a breadbasket that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century. The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the Pacification of Araucanía. The Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists describe it as a civilising mission, while revisionists label it a genocide.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Aceh War	97,000-107,000	1873-1914	Kingdom of the Netherlands vs. Aceh Sultanate	Indonesia		Infidel War	The Aceh War (Indonesian: Perang Aceh), also known as the Dutch War or the Infidel War (1873-1904), was an armed military conflict between the Sultanate of Aceh and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which was triggered by discussions between representatives of Aceh and the United States in Singapore during early 1873.[8] The war was part of a series of conflicts in the late 19th century that consolidated Dutch rule over modern-day Indonesia. The campaign drew controversy in the Netherlands as photographs and accounts of the death toll were reported. Isolated bloody insurgencies continued as late as 1914 and less violent forms of Acehnese resistance continued to persist until World War II and the Japanese occupation.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	First Sino-Japanese War	48,311+	1894-1895	Qing China vs. Japan	East Asia	A large factor in the weakening of Qing China.	War of Jiawu, Japan-Qing War, Qing-Japan War	The First Sino-Japanese War (25 July 1894 - 17 April 1895) was a conflict between the Qing dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan primarily over influence in Joseon Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895. The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Cuban War of Independence	362,000+	1895-1898	USA and Cuba vs. Spain	Cuba			The Cuban War of Independence (Spanish: Guerra de Independencia cubana, 1895-1898) was the last of three liberation wars that Cuba fought against Spain, the other two being the Ten Years' War (1868-1878) and the Little War (1879-1880). The final three months of the conflict escalated to become the Spanish-American War, with United States forces being deployed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands against Spain. Historians disagree as to the extent that United States officials were motivated to intervene for humanitarian reasons but agree that yellow journalism exaggerated atrocities attributed to Spanish forces against Cuban civilians.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Thousand Days' War	120,000+	1899-1902	Colombian Conservatives vs. Colombian Liberals	Colombia			The Thousand Days' War was a civil war fought in Colombia from 17 October 1899 to 21 November 1902, at first between the Liberal Party and the government led by the National Party, and later - after the Conservative Party had ousted the National Party - between the liberals and the conservative government. Caused by the longstanding ideological tug-of-war of federalism versus centralism between the liberals, conservatives, and nationalists of Colombia following the implementation of the Constitution of 1886 and the political process known as the Regeneración (es), tensions reached a fever pitch after the presidential election of 1898, and in 17 October 1899, official insurrection against the National government was announced by members of the Liberal Party in the Department of Santander. Hostilities didn't begin until the 11th of November, when liberal factions attempted to take over the city of Bucaramanga, giving way to active warfare. It would end three years later with the signing of the Treaty of Neerlandia and the Treaty of Wisconsin. The war resulted in a Conservative victory, and ensured the continued dominance of the Conservative Party in Colombian politics for another 28 years. Colombia's political structure as a unitary state has not been challenged since.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

The trigger of the war was the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Boer states. Initial Boer attacks were successful, and although British reinforcements later reversed these, the war continued for years with Boer guerrilla warfare, until harsh British counter-measures including a scorched earth policy brought the Boers to terms.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Philippine-American War	234,000+	1899-1912	Philippines vs. USA	Philippines		Filipino-American War, Philippine War, Philippine Insurrection, Tagalog Insurgency	The Philippine-American War was an armed conflict between the First Philippine Republic and the United States that lasted from February 4, 1899 to July 2, 1902. While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution, the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection. The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain, ending the Spanish-American War.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Mexican Revolution	500,000-2,000,000	1910-1920	Revolutionary Forces vs. Anti-Revolutionary Forces	Mexico			The Mexican Revolution (Spanish: Revolución Mexicana) was a major revolution that included a sequence of armed struggles that lasted roughly from 1910 to 1920 and transformed Mexican culture and government. The outbreak of the revolution in 1910 resulted from the increasing unpopularity of the 31-year regime of Porfirio Díaz and the regime's failure to find a controlled solution to the issue of presidential succession. That resulted in a power struggle among competing elites, which provided the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. The wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in the 1910 presidential election and, following the rigged results, revolted under the October 1910 Plan of San Luis Potosí.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Balkan Wars	140,000+	1912-1913	see Balkan wars	Balkan Peninsula	The war restricted Ottoman control in Europe to territories around Istanbul		The Balkan Wars consisted of two conflicts that took place in the Balkan Peninsula in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples. The war set the stage for the Balkan crisis of 1914 and thus served as a "prelude to the First World War".	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Contemporaneously known as the Great War or "the war to end all wars", it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated 9 million combatant deaths and 13 million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war, while resulting genocides and the related 1918 Spanish flu pandemic caused another 17-100 million deaths worldwide, including an estimated 2.64 million Spanish flu deaths in Europe and as many as 675,000 Spanish flu deaths in the United States	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Russian Civil War	5,000,000-9,000,000	1917-1922	Red army and allies vs. White army and allies	Russia			The Russian Civil War was a multi-party civil war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the two Russian revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favouring political monarchism, capitalism and social democracy, each with democratic and anti-democratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists, notably Makhnovia anarchists and Left SRs, as well as non-ideological Green armies, fought against both the Reds and the Whites. Thirteen foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the former Allied military forces from the just-concluded World War with the goal of re-establishing the Eastern Front. Three foreign nations of the Central Powers also intervened, rivaling the Allied intervention with the main goal of retaining the territory they had received in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Kurdish separatism in Iran	15,000-58,000	1918-present	Qajar dynasty vs. Shekak (tribe)	Iran		Kurdish–Iranian conflict	Kurdish separatism in Iran is an ongoing, long-running, separatist dispute between the Kurdish opposition in Western Iran and the governments of Iran, lasting since the emergence of Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1918. The earliest Kurdish separatist activities in modern times refer to tribal revolts in today's West Azerbaijan Province of the Imperial State of Iran, which began between the two World Wars – the largest of these were led by Simko Shikak, Jafar Sultan and Hama Rashid. Many however, put the starting point of the organized Kurdish political-nationalist separatism at 1943, when Komala (shortly afterwards the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) began their political activities in Iran, aiming to gain partial or complete self-rule in the Kurdish regions. Transformation from tribal to Kurdish political struggle in Iran took place in the aftermath of World War II, with the KDPI establishing the Republic of Mahabad during the 1946 Iran crisis. The USSR-supported attempt to establish a Kurdish state in Western Iran failed. More than a decade later, peripheral tribal uprisings, launched with KDPI support through 1966–7. In the most violent episode of the conflict, more than 30,000 Kurds died in the 1979 rebellion and the consequent KDPI insurgency. Though the KDPI's armed struggle ended in late 1996, another Kurdish armed organization emerged in Iran by the early 2000s. The ongoing Iran-PJAK conflict started in 2004.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Iraqi-Kurdish conflict	138,800-320,100	1918-2003	Kurdistan/Iraqi Kurdistan and allies vs. Iraq and allies	Iraq			The Iraqi-Kurdish conflict consists of a series of wars and rebellions by the Kurds against the central authority of Iraq during the 20th century, which began shortly after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and lasting until the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some put the marking point of the conflict beginning to the attempt by Mahmud Barzanji to establish an independent Kingdom of Kurdistan, while others relate to the conflict as only the post-1961 insurrection by the Barzanis. The conflict lasted until the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, though tensions between the Kurdish autonomy and the central Iraqi government have continued.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
Modern	Kurdish rebellions in Turkey	100,000+	1921-present	Turkey vs. Kurdish people	Middle East			Kurdish rebellions in Turkey refer to Kurdish nationalist uprisings in Turkey, beginning with the Turkish War of Independence and the consequent transition from the Ottoman Empire into the modern Turkish state and lasting until present with the ongoing Kurdish-Turkish conflict. According to Ottoman military records, Kurdish rebellions have been taking place in Anatolia for over two centuries, While large tribal Kurdish revolts had shaken the Ottoman Empire through the last decades of its existence, the conflict in its modern phase is considered to have begun in 1922, with the emergence of Kurdish nationalism in parallel with the formation of the modern State of Turkey. In 1925, an uprising for an independent Kurdistan, led by Shaikh Said Piran, was put down quickly, and Said and 36 of his followers were executed soon thereafter. Other large-scale Kurdish revolts occurred in Ararat and Dersim in 1930 and 1937.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll

Modern	Chinese Civil War	8,000,000-11,692,000	1927-1949	ROC vs. PRC	China			The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China (ROC) and forces of the Communist Party of China (CPC) lasting intermittently between 1927 and 1949. The war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude: from August 1927 to 1937, the KMT-CPC Alliance collapsed during the Northern Expedition, and the Nationalists controlled most of China. From 1937 to 1945, hostilities were put on hold, and the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the Allies of World War II. The civil war resumed with the Japanese defeat, and the CPC gained the upper hand in the final phase of the war from 1945 to 1949, generally referred to as the Chinese Communist Revolution.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll
