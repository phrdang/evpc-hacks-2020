The fighting took place primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia. It lasted 23 years, until 241 BC, when after immense materiel and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.

While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the Gallic tribes' internal divisions helped ease victory for Caesar; Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. Although Caesar portrayed the invasion as being a preemptive and defensive action, most historians agree he fought the wars primarily to boost his political career and to pay off his massive debts. Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as native tribes, both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north, had attacked them several times.
